	•	App.jsx - The main component that sets up routing.
	•	components/ - Reusable UI components.
	•	pages/ - Different page views (e.g., Home, Login, Product, Cart).
	•	store/ - Likely handles state management (Redux or Context API).
	•	config/ - Stores API configurations.
	•	lib/ - Utility functions.
	•	assets/ - Stores images, icons, and other static assets.

# Key Frontend Features
	•	State Management - Redux.
